# Intro-To-Python
## Course Overview
This was the course that introduced me to programming and the fundamentals of Computer Science. 

The goal of the course is to learn Python like a Professional, start from the basics, and go all the way to creating your own applications and games. 

I had a great time learning the basics of Python and applying them with each checkpoint quiz and milestone project.
